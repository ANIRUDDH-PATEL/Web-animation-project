## My First HTML Animation Project ##
Welcome to my first web project! This is a pure HTML animation project that I created to explore web development and animation. It's a simple project aimed at demonstrating my initial steps in web development.

### Project Overview ###
This project showcases an animation created entirely with HTML and CSS. While it may not be a complex or feature-rich application, it represents my first attempt to combine web technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

### Features ###
 1. Pure HTML Animation: The entire animation is built using HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript or external libraries.
 2. Interactive Elements: The animation may include interactive elements that respond to user actions (e.g., mouse hover, clicks).
 3.  Customization: Explain how users can customize or interact with the animation if applicable.

### Technologies Used ###
1. HTML
2. CSS
